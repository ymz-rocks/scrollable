# scrollable

Upgrade your web pages with great-looking clean scrolling areas. This lib is based on **Dragga.js** (a plugin for jQuery).


### Features

1. Each scroll element may be scrolled by a finger gesture (for touch screens) / by a classic scroller
2. The behavior of the scroll (gesture only / classic scroll only / both) can be easily configured
3. Total freedom to design it the way you want - every scrollable is 100% configurable by css
4. Control everything from js with easy-to-use listeners (*start*, *drag*, *end*)

### What's next?

Download the repository, run the demo, copy to a test web page and play with it! 

### Support

Well.. it based on **Dragga.js**.. so - whatever dragga support :)
